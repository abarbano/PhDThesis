\chapter{$\Dsplus$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\s$ = 5.02 TeV}
\label{chap:PbPb}
In this Chapter the measurements of the $\pt$-differential yield,
the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow of $\Dsplus$ mesons
in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sNN = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. Data were
collected during the LHC Run2 in 2015 and recorded with a 
minimum-bias interaction trigger that required coincident signals in 
both scintillator arrays of the V0 detector. Events produced by 
the interaction of the beams with residual gas in the
vacuum pipe were rejected offline using the V0 and the ZDC 
timing information. Only events with a reconstructed primary vertex 
within $\pm 10$ cm from the centre of the ITS detector along
the beam line were analysed. The centrality classes 
used in the analysis, the corresponding 
average nuclear overlap functions $\av{\TAA}$~\cite{ALICE-PUBLIC-2015-008} 
and the number of events ($N_{\rm events}$) in each class 
are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:Nevents}. The corresponding 
integrated luminosity is $L_{\rm int}=13.04\pm0.4~\mub^{-1}$.\\

For sake of clarity, we will start with the description of $\pt$-differential yields and $\RAA$ 
analyses and move to the analysis of elliptic flow in the second part of the Chapter. 
The results of the measurements will be discussed together in Sec.~\ref{sec:PbPbResults}.

\section{$\Dsplus$ $\pt$-differential yields}
\label{sec:YieldsAndRaa}
\subsection{Signal extraction}
\label{sec:SelectionPbPb}
$\Dspm$ mesons in Pb-Pb collisions were reconstructed 
and selected with the same strategy adopted in the analysis of pp 
collisions (see Sec.~\ref{sec:DsRecoStrategy}). The differences with respect to
the analysis performed in proton-proton collisions are due to the much larger
combinatorial background that is a consequence of the very 
high particle multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, 
in the Pb-Pb analysis, stricter selections on the tracks 
used to build the $\Dspm$ candidates and on the geometrical selections
on the displaced decay vertex topology were applied. 
The stricter selections on the decay tracks contributed also to reduce the computing resources 
needed to build and store the candidates. \\



In Tables~\ref{tab:topologicalselections_ds_010},~\ref{tab:topologicalselections_ds_3050} 
and~\ref{tab:topologicalselections_ds_6080}, the topological selections applied 
in the 0-10$\%$, 30-50\% and 60-80$\%$ centrality classes
to extract the raw yields in different $\pt$ intervals are reported.\\



The PID selection is the same used in the analysis of pp collisions and 
is described in Sec.~\ref{Sec:PID}. It considers a track to be 
compatible with the kaon or pion hypothesis 
if both its d$E$/d$x$ and time-of-flight are within 3$\sigma$ from the expected values. 
Tracks without a TOF signal (mostly at low momentum) are 
identified using only the TPC information and requiring a 2$\sigma$ 
compatibility with the expected d$E$/d$x$. This selection was used 
in the low $\pt$ region for the 0-10\% and 30-50\% centrality classes 
($\pt < 6 \, \Gevc$ and $\pt < 8 \, \Gevc$ respectively) 
and for the most peripheral 60-80\% class at all $\pt$. For the high $\pt$ regions
in the 0-10\% and 30-50\% classes, the looser PID selection introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:PIDsystPP}
was applied since it provided good values of statistical significance of the extracted yields.

 \end{center}
\end{table}

 The $\Ds$ signal in the 0-10$\%$ and 30-50\% centrality classes was extracted in four $\pt$ 
 intervals in the transverse momentum region $4 < \pt <16 \, \Gevc$, while the lower limit was extended down to 2 GeV/$c$
for the 60-80\% class. Fig.~\ref{fig:FigInvMassDs_pbpb} shows the signal extraction
from fits to the invariant-mass histograms, in the selected $\pt$ intervals
$4 < \pt <6 \, \Gevc$ and $12 < \pt < 16 \, \Gevc$ for the 0-10\% (top row) and 30-50\%
(middle) classes and in $2 < \pt < 4 \, \Gevc$ and  $8 < \pt < 12 \, \Gevc$ for
the 60-80\% class. The distributions were fitted with two Gaussian functions to model
the $\Ds$ peak and that of $\DplustoKKpi$ decays, with BR = ($0.264 \pm 0.011\%$),
which gives rise to a bump in the background shape around 1.870 $\Gevcc$. 
An exponential function was used to model the background.
The $\Ds$ raw yield (sum of particles and anti-particles) is defined as the integral of the $\Ds$ Gaussian 
after subtracting the background calculated from the 
background fit function. 
The values of raw yields and signal over background are reported in
Tab.~\ref{tab:signalDs_010_3050_6080} for the analysed $\pt$ intervals and in the three centrality classes.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:MCsigmacheckDs} the values of the Gaussian mean and width of $\Ds$ 
peak line shape are compared to the values obtained from the simulation, as a function of $\pt$, in the 
three considered centrality classes.

\subsection{Corrections}
\label{sec:CorrectionsAA}
The $\Dspm$-meson raw yields were corrected in order to obtain the
$\pt$-differential yields of prompt $\Dsplus$ mesons: 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dNdpt}
  \left.\frac{{\rm d} N^{\Dsplus}}{{\rm d}\pt}\right|_{|y|<0.5}=
  \frac{\left.f_{\rm prompt}(\pt)\cdot \frac{1}{2} N_{\rm raw}^{\rm
        \Dspm}(\pt)\right|_{|y|<y_{\rm fid}}}{\Delta\pt \cdot
   C_{\Delta y} \cdot ({\rm Acc}\times\epsilon)_{\rm prompt}(\pt)
    \cdot{\rm BR} \cdot N_{\rm events}}\,.
\end{equation}
The raw yields $N_{\rm raw}^{\rm \Dspm}$ were divided by 
a factor of two to obtain the charge-averaged (particle and antiparticle) 
yields. To correct for the contribution of feed-down from B-meson decays,
 the raw yields were multiplied by the fraction of promptly produced D 
 mesons, $f_{\rm prompt}$. Furthermore, they were divided by the product 
 of prompt D-meson acceptance and efficiency 
 $({\rm Acc}\times\epsilon)_{\rm prompt}$, by the branching ratio {\rm BR} 
 of the decay channel, by the transverse momentum interval width 
 ($\Delta \pt$) and by the number of events ($N_{\rm events}$). The rapidity acceptance 
 correction factor $C_{\Delta y}= 2 y_{\rm fid}(\pt)$ was calculated as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:corrPP}.

The correction for acceptance and efficiency $({\rm Acc}\times\epsilon)_{\rm prompt}$ 
was determined using Monte Carlo simulations with a detailed description 
of the detector and its response, based on the GEANT3 transport 
package~\cite{Brun:1994aa}. 
The underlying Pb--Pb events at $\sqrtsNN = 5.02$~TeV were simulated 
using the HIJING v1.383 generator~\cite{Wang:1991hta} and D-meson 
signals were added with the PYTHIA v6.421 generator~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} 
with Perugia-2011 tune. Each simulated PYTHIA event contained a 
$\rm c\overline c$ or $\rm b\overline b$ pair. Only the particles originating from the 
fragmentation of $c$ ($\bar{c}$) and $b$ ($\bar{b}$) quarks were
injected in the event. D mesons were forced to 
decay into the hadronic channels of interest for the analysis.

\caption{Acceptance times efficiency for $\Ds$ mesons in the three centrality classes, as a function of $\pt$, for prompt (red) and feed-down (blue) components.}
\label{fig:DsAccEff}
\end{figure}
The number of $c\bar{c}$ pairs added to each Pb-Pb 
event was adjusted according to the Pb-Pb collision centrality. 
The efficiencies were evaluated in a centrality class 
corresponding to the one used in 
data in terms of charged particle 
multiplicity in the mid-rapidity region, hence of the detector occupancy.
In the most central event class, the generated $\pt$ distribution 
of $\Ds$ mesons was tuned utilising a re-weighting procedure in order to match the 
shape measured for \mbox{$\rm D^0$ mesons} in finer 
$\pt$ intervals. In the other two centrality classes, 
where an analysis of $\Dzero$-meson yield in finer $\pt$ intervals was not possible, 
the simulated $\Ds$-meson $\pt$ distribution was weighted 
to match the shape given by fixed-order next-to-leading-log 
perturbative QCD calculations (FONLL)~\cite{Cacciari:1998it,Cacciari:2001td} 
multiplied by the $\RAA(\pt)$ of D mesons computed 
using the BAMPS model for semi-central 
collisions~\cite{Uphoff:2011ad,Fochler:2011en,Uphoff:2012gb}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:DsAccEff} shows the acceptance-times-efficiency 
corrections for prompt and feed-down $\Ds$ mesons in the three
centrality classes.
Some of the topological selections tend to reject 
less feed-down due to the larger 
decay length with respect to the prompt D mesons. 
Other topological cuts, like the one on the normalised 
track-impact parameter residual, are more effective
in rejecting the feed-down component, allowing higher 
prompt efficiencies at high $\pt$.
The reconstruction and selection efficiencies for prompt and feed-down
$\Ds$ mesons in Pb-Pb collisions are smaller than the results in pp 
collisions up to a factor of 3 as a consequence ofthe tighter topological selection applied. \\

 \caption{Impact parameter resolution in the transverse plane (left) and mean value (right) in 2015 Pb-Pb data taking at $\sNN = 5.02$ TeV for low interaction rate runs compared to Monte Carlo simulations.}
 \label{fig:d0}
\end{figure}



Fig.~\ref{fig:d0} shows the resolution of the impact parameter of reconstructed tracks 
in the transverse plane ($d_{\rm 0}^{\rm xy}$), for low interaction rate runs in data and in simulations.
The values of the resolution are obtained via a fit to the distributions of $d_{\rm 0}^{\rm xy}$ 
of charged tracks, in the different $\pt$ intervals. The histograms are fitted by a function consisting of a sum
of a Gaussian, to describe the $d_{\rm 0}^{\rm xy}$ of primary particles, and an exponential
function for the tails of the distribution, that are generated by the contribution of secondary tracks,
with average larger values of $d_{\rm 0}^{\rm xy}$. The position of the Gaussian function
should be compatible with 0 for an unbiased description, while the width is
the resolution on the impact parameter values, which depends on the transverse momentum.
The values of the impact parameter resolution in data are not fully reproduced
in the simulations (see Fig.~\ref{fig:d0}, left panel).
Furthermore, the impact parameter distribution is shifted to negative 
values by up to 10-15 micron at low $\pt$ and 
decreasing to 5-10 micron at high $\pt$. The shift 
depends on the azimuthal angle and is not described 
in the MC (Fig.~\ref{fig:d0}, right panel). 
In order to reduce possible systematic effects arising from these discrepancies
between data and simulations, a tuning procedure of the Monte Carlo output
was developed.
%Current hypothesis is that part of the shift 
%is due to the presence of SPD modules that were not 
%included in the detector alignment (because they were
% included only afterwards in the data taking). 
 The impact parameter resolution measured in data 
 was reproduced in MC by applying to the tracks of the simulated sample a scaling of 
the residuals ${\rm d}_0^{\rm true}-{\rm d}_0^{\rm reco}$ 
 according to the data-to-MC ratio of the impact parameter 
 resolutions. A shift of d$_0^{\rm reco}$ was also applied to correct for the different bias in MC and in data.
 The covariance matrix of the track was also
 updated after the corrections, in order not to introduce biases at the level
 of topological variables based on standardised quantities such as the normalised decay length. 
 These corrections were verified to have small impact on D-meson efficiencies.\\
 


The $f_{\rm prompt}$ factor, which corrects for the contribution of 
D mesons from B-meson decays in the measured raw yield 
in each $\pt$ interval, was obtained following the procedure described in Sec~\ref{sec:ppFprompt}. 
The expression for $f_{\rm prompt}$ reads:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fprAA}
\begin{split}
f_{\mathrm{prompt}} = \, & 1- \frac{N^{\text{D~feed-down}}_{\mathrm{raw}}}{N^{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{raw}}}=\\
& 1- \RAA ^{\rm feed-down} \cdot  \langle \TAA \rangle \left (\frac{\rm d^2 \sigma}{\mathrm d\pt \mathrm d y} \right)^{\rm FONLL}_{\text{feed-down}} \cdot  \frac{(\mathrm{Acc} \times \epsilon)_\text{feed-down} \cdot \Delta y \Delta \pt \cdot \mathrm{BR} \cdot L_{\rm int}}{N^{\rm D +\overline{D},raw}/2}\,.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The difference with respect to Eq.~\ref{eq:fpr} is that the beauty-hadron 
production cross section from FONLL pQCD
calculations in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02~\tev$~\cite{Cacciari:2012ny}
is multiplied by the average nuclear overlap function $\langle \TAA \rangle$ of the corresponding centrality class. 
In addition, a hypothesis on the nuclear 
modification factor of feed-down $\Ds$ mesons, $\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}$, was 
introduced to account for the different modification of beauty and charm 
production in Pb-Pb collisions. The resulting sample of 
feed-down $\Ds$ mesons is composed of two 
contributions: about 50\% of the feed-down originates from 
B$^0_{\rm s}$-meson decays, while the remaining 50\% comes from decays of 
non-strange B mesons (B$^0$ and B$^+$) (see Fig.~\ref{fig:DsParents}).
To determine the central value of $f_{\rm prompt}$ in the 0-10\% 
and 30-50\% centrality classes, it was assumed that the 
nuclear modification factors of feed-down and prompt $\Ds$ mesons were equal 
($\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}=\RAA^{\rm prompt}$). 
The resulting feed-down contribution is about 10\%, depending on the
$\pt$ interval.
To determine the systematic uncertainty the hypothesis
was varied in the range $1/3<\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}/\RAA^{\rm prompt}<3$, as 
discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:systematics}.
It should be noted that the central value and the range of the hypothesis
on $\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}/\RAA^{\rm prompt}$ differ from those used for
non-strange D mesons in Refs.~\cite{ALICE-PUBLIC-2017-003,Adam:2015sza}. The 
central hypothesis of $\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}/\RAA^{\rm prompt}$ for non-strange
D mesons is in fact set at 2  due to the comparison of the $\RAA$ of prompt D mesons at 
$\sNN = 2.76$ TeV~\cite{Adam:2015nna} with that of J/$\psi$ from B-meson decays~\cite{Khachatryan:2016ypw} 
measured in the CMS experiment (see Sec.~\ref{sec:resAAcap2}), that indicates that charmed hadrons 
with $\pt > 8 \, \Gevc$ are more suppressed than beauty hadrons in semi-peripheral and central
Pb-Pb collisions relative to binary scaled pp collisions. The hypothesis for $\Ds$ meson
accounts for the recombination in the charm and beauty sectors.
The contribution of coalescence of charm quarks should enhance the $\RAA$ of
$\Ds$ with respect to that of non-strange D mesons. If recombination does not occur
for beauty quarks, the suppression of $\Ds$ could result similar to that of  B$^0$, B$^+$ and B$^0_{\rm s}$
mesons. If, on the other hand, recombination plays a role for beauty,
the hypothesis on $\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}$ accounts for a possible enhancement 
of the ratio of B$^0_{\rm s}$ over non-strange B mesons~\cite{TAMULHC}
and for the large fraction of feed-down $\Ds$ mesons originating from non-strange B-meson decays.
For the peripheral class 60--80\%, in which the medium effects are milder, 
also the difference between charm and beauty mesons is assumed to be 
reduced: the value $\RAA^{\textnormal{feed-down}}=1.3\cdot\RAA^{\rm prompt}$ 
was used for all D-meson species and the range of the hypothesis to estimate the
uncertainty was reduced.

\section{Systematic uncertainty on corrected d$N$/d$\pt$}
\label{sec:systematics}
Most of the sources of systematic uncertainty considered for the analysis 
of the corrected yields and the methods used to estimate them were already described in Sec.~\ref{sec:systPP}. 
Hence in the next sections we will concentrate on the differences with respect to the 
pp analysis. Table~\ref{tab:sysunc_yieldtable} summarises the 
assigned systematic uncertainties, as an example for the 0-10\% class. 

\subsection{Yield extraction systematics}
\label{sec:YieldExsystAA}
The estimate of the systematic uncertainty on the yield extraction
was based on the multiple-trial fit approach described in Sec.~\ref{sec:RawYieldSyst}
(it is the first approach of the two presented there).
Fig.~\ref{fig:multitrial_Ds_010} shows an example of the multiple trial fit procedure on the invariant-mass
distribution in the interval $4 < \pt < 6 \, \Gevc$, for the 0-10\% centrality class.
The panels of the figure show, starting from top left plot:
(i) the raw yield distributions from the multiple trials,
with the histograms obtained via fit and bin counting shown
in different colours; (ii) the distribution of raw yields from multiple 
trials, distinguishing the cases in which the Gaussian width of the signal function was left as free parameter 
in the fit, or was fixed to its MC value or fixed to MC value $\pm$ 15\%; 
(iii) the distribution of the reduced $\chi^{2}$ of the fits; 
(iv) the Gaussian width of the peak as a function of the trial 
number; (v) the raw yield distribution as a 
function of the trial number; (vi) a panel reporting the Gaussian RMS value (used as
estimator of the systematic uncertainty) of the yield distribution
in three cases: considering the yields extracted from the fits with 
all possible values for the Gaussian sigma parameter (free, fixed to MC, fixed to MC $\pm$ 15\%), 
as well as those obtained considering only the cases with sigma free, fixed to MC, fixed to 
MC +15\% or with sigma free, fixed to MC, fixed to MC -15\%. 
In this way, for those $\pt$ intervals for which the values 
of the Gaussian width as free parameter were on average displaced towards 
values around MC sigma values +(-)15\%, the RMS of the second (third) 
distribution was chosen to give the final systematics. 
It was verified that the difference between the mean values of the yield distributions from fit
and from bin counting methods was contained within the RMS value quoted 
as systematic uncertainty.
The final assigned uncertainties range from 5\% to 10\% depending on $\pt$ and
centrality class and are reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:sysunc_yieldtable}.

\subsection{Selection efficiency}
\label{sec:CutVarsystAA}
The systematic uncertainty on the efficiency of the $\Ds$ selection was studied
via cut variation procedures, similarly to what done for pp collisions (see Sec.~\ref{sec:CutVariation}).
A systematic scan from looser to tighter cuts was done on a variable-per-variable 
basis, extracting the raw yields, correcting them with the corresponding efficiency, 
comparing the corrected yields to those obtained 
with a reference set of cuts and looking for possible trends/biases of 
the corrected yield as a function of the cut strength.
The study was done using as reference set of cuts the one used 
to provide the central values of the yields. A selection
on the basis of the $\chi^2/ndf$ ($<2.5$) of the invariant-mass fits and the statistical significance ($>2$)
of the signal was applied to reject the sets of cuts that were not showing a robust 
determination of the raw yield.  
An example of the scan performed on the cut on the
reconstructed K$^+$K$^-$ invariant-mass pair is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DsCutVar_010}.
The top-left panel shows the ratios of the corrected yields 
(at a specific cut value) to that obtained with the default
cut, in different colours for the different $\pt$ intervals.
Some systematic deviations from unity of this ratio are visible when the selection
on this variable is released with respect to the default cut ($\Delta M < $ 4-6 GeV/$c^2$ depending
on the $\pt$ interval). 
This behaviour could be due to a systematic effect originating, e.g., from a 
different $\pt$ resolutions in data and in MC, as well as to a less-reliable extraction of 
the raw yield in the cases of low S/B ratios with loose selections.
The statistical significance (top-right panel) of the signal and
the reduced $\chi^2$ (middle-top panel) as a function of the cut value were also considered.
The relative variation of the selection
efficiencies with respect to that with default set of cuts is shown in the bottom-left panel.
Finally, in the bottom-middle panel the ratio of the selection efficiency to the square root of 
background counts in the interval within $3\sigma$ around the peak complements 
the information from the statistical significance,
and it is less affected by possible fluctuations of the signal.
The corrected yields from this study were collected, for each $\pt$ interval,
into final distributions, whose RMS values provide an estimate for the systematic uncertainty.
Fig.~\ref{DsCutVar_010} shows an example of these final distributions 
for the 0-10\% centrality class, in the four analysed $\pt$ intervals. 
The values of the RMS of the Gaussian distributions are reported, as well as
the values of the full spread of the distribution divided by $\sqrt{12}$,
for comparison. 

\subsection{PID selection efficiency}
\label{sec:PIDsystAA}
To estimate the systematic uncertaintiy due to PID efficiency,
two particle identification selections (a tighter one, discussed in Sec.~\ref{Sec:PID}, and a 
looser, in Sec.~\ref{sec:PIDsystPP}) were compared. Fig.~\ref{fig:DsPID010} 
shows, as an example for 0-10\% centrality class, the ratio of the corrected yields 
with looser and tighter PID selections. Due to the large error bars, it is difficult to asses
whether the points are affected by a systematic effect
or they are dominated by statistical fluctuations.
For this reason, an alternative approach of a per-track estimate of the PID
systematic was followed. The idea is to select samples of kaon and pion tracks in data and
MC. 

The difference in the efficiencies for a given N$\sigma$ cut (on d$E$/d$x$ or 
time-of-flight signal) in data and MC will
constitute a $\pt$-dependent per-track systematics for each species.

\begin{figure}[!h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[angle=0, width=7cm]{./FigCap5/PIDsyst_010.eps}
 \caption{Ratio of $\Ds$ corrected yield in 0--10\% centrality class with tighter-to-looser PID selections.}
 \label{fig:DsPID010} 
\end{figure}
Pions from V0 decays were selected using the optimised cuts
used in~\cite{Schuchmann:2102194}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:MCPionsTPC} the Monte Carlo 
N$\sigma$ distributions for the d$E$/d$x$ of pions in TPC are shown for 
different $\pt$ intervals, from 0.2 to 10 $\Gevc$.
The N$\sigma$ distributions of pions (in green) selected utilising the MC truth are compared to the
those of tracks passing the selection as pions from V0 decays 
(in blue). A peak centred at N$\sigma=0$ is the dominant contribution for both
track samples.
A second population is visible at the right of the peak at low $\pt$ in the in the N$\sigma$ distribution
of pion candidate tracks from V0 decays, 
only the left side of the peak will be used to study the systematic uncertainty.
A part from this small contamination, we conclude that the utilised selections provide a pure
enough sample of pions. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:DataPionsTPC}, the N$\sigma$ distributions in data (blue) are compared
to the distributions of true MC pions (green), in the different $\pt$ intervals.  
Finally, efficiencies in data and in MC are obtained by integrating the respective 
distributions (blue and green distributions in Fig.~\ref{fig:DataPionsTPC})
within 1, 2 or 3$\sigma$, and normalising these values to the integral 
of the distributions within 5$\sigma$. It was verified that enlarging the number of $\sigma$ from 5 to 10 at the 
denominator of the efficiency does not affect the final results.
The same procedure
was carried out with the N$\sigma$ distributions of time-of-flight signals in TOF
for the above selected pions from V0 decays, to obtained the systematics on pion identification in TOF.
To obtain the uncertainty on kaon identification in TPC, a tight cut on the PID 
signal in TOF, requiring the signal to be within N$\sigma < 0.25\sigma$ from kaon hypothesis, was appliednon. 
The black curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:MCKaonsTPC} shows the d$E$/d$x$ 
N$\sigma$ values of reconstructed tracks in the simulation that satisfy this selection.
Contaminations from other particle species are still present and they
are shown in different colours in the same Fig.~\ref{fig:MCKaonsTPC}. 
The black curve was fitted with a Gaussian shape 
to extrapolate the kaon contribution. The ranges of the fits are set, for each $\pt$ interval, in 
the regions less affected by other species contribution.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:DataKaonsTPC}, the distribution of d$E$/d$x$ in data is displayed. 
The yellow Monte Carlo templates of true 
kaons are superimposed to the data distributions, 
only for visualisation purposes, and not used in the fits. The curve in data
was fitted with a Gaussian function in the $x$-axis range previously tuned with the MC,
to extrapolate the kaon component from the inclusive distribution, in each $\pt$ interval.\\
The values of the final systematics, obtained as the data-to-MC ratio
of the efficiencies are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:PerTrackPIDsys}, as a function of $\pt$,
for cuts at 1, 2 and 3$\sigma$ on the PID signal. 
Since the systematic uncertainties on pion and kaon identification in 
TPC show similar values, an assumption for the systematic uncertainty 
on kaon identification in TOF is done and it is considered to be similar to that of pions in TOF,
considering that it is not possible to extract a pure enough kaon
sample with standalone TOF.
The per-track systematics can be propagated to the D-meson level, via the kinematics of
the daughter tracks.
These $\pt$-dependent per-track values were then associated to
$\Ds$' daughter tracks, depending on their transverse momentum, and linearly summed together 
for each candidate that passed the topological selections discussed 
in Sec.~\ref{sec:CutVarsystAA}. The correlation between the
$\pt$ of the daughter track and that of $\Ds$ mesons is visible in the
left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:DsPIDsys}.
The final values of the systematic uncertainties are around 
3\% for the tighter (Sec.~\ref{Sec:PID}) PID selection (see Fig.~\ref{fig:DsPIDsys}) and are negligible for the
looser PID selection (Sec.~\ref{sec:PIDsystPP}).

\subsection{Generated $\pt$ shape}
The systematic effect on the efficiency due to a possible difference between 
the real and simulated $\Ds$-meson transverse momentum distributions
was estimated by using alternative $\Ds$-meson $\pt$ distributions.
In particular, the $\pt$ distributions from FONLL calculations with
and without hot-medium effects parametrised based on the $\RAA$ in central collisions from the 
TAMU~\cite{He:2014cla} model and in semi-central collisions from 
BAMPS~\cite{Uphoff:2014hza} model were used in this study.
The values assigned as systematic uncertainty are reported in 
Table~\ref{tab:sysunc_yieldtable} for the 0-10\% centrality class, but are similar in 
30-50\% and 60-80\% classes.

\end{figure}
\fi

\subsection{Feed-down subtraction}
\label{sec:FDsystAA}
The systematic uncertainty on the subtraction of feed-down from 
B-meson decays was estimated by varying i)
the $\pt$-differential feed-down D-meson cross section from the 
FONLL calculation within the theoretical uncertainties (that originate from variations on 
$b$-quark mass, perturbative scales and on the parton distribution functions~\cite{Cacciari:2012ny}), 
ii) the ratio of the prompt and feed-down $\Ds$-meson $\Raa$ in the 
range $\frac{1}{3} < \RAA^{\rm  feed-down}/\RAA^{\rm prompt} < 3$ 
for the centrality classes 0-10\% and 30-50\%. The range was limited to 
$1 < \RAA^{\rm  feed-down} / \RAA^{\rm prompt} < 1.6$ 
for the centrality class 60-80\%. 

\subsection{Track reconstruction efficiency}
\label{sec:TrackEffSystPbPb}
The procedure to estimate the difference
of tracking efficiency between data and MC was discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:TrackEffSystPP}.
The per-track uncertainty quoted to account for track-quality selection efficiencies
is 1.5\% in the 10\% most central events and 1\% in 30-50\% and 60-80\% 
centrality classes. As regards the systematic uncertainty on the ITS-TPC 
track-matching efficiency, some discrepancies (up to 4\%, for $2 < \pt < 4\, \Gevc$) 
are observed in the final systematics for Pb-Pb data
when switching off the request of a hit in one of the two SPD 
layers for the tracks used to perform the DCA$_{\rm xy}$ fits.
As explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:TrackEffSystPP}, this request is 
preferable since the DCA$_{\rm xy}$
resolution is more accurate, thus differences between primary and secondary track DCA$_{\rm xy}$ 
distributions can be appreciated. This request also implies 
a correction factor to rescale the fraction of primary tracks in the ITS
to the same fraction in TPC. Such factor is extracted from MC and it
lays on the hypothesis that simulation can reproduce the ITS to TPC 
relative abundance of primary tracks 
as in data. For the case 
without the request of hit in the SPD, the DCA$_{\rm xy}$
resolution is worse, anyhow the fits can be performed with still acceptable data-to-fit agreement.
The observed discrepancy in the results between the two cases 
may be due to the less precise estimate
of the fraction of primary tracks due to looser resolution power as well as
to a non valid assumption on the correction factor. For this reason, the systematic 
uncertainty on the ITS-TPC matching efficiency for the single track was
assigned by averaging the two results, resulting in
2.5-4\% for $0.5 < \pt < 5 \, \Gevc$, 2.5-1\% for $5 < \pt < 10 \, \Gevc$, 1\% for $10 < \pt < 15\, \Gevc$.\\


The values of the systematic uncertainties on the $\pt$-dependent corrected yields
are summarised in Tab.~\ref{tab:sysunc_yieldtable}.

\section{Nuclear modification factor in Pb-Pb collisions}
\label{sec:RAA}
The nuclear modification factor $\RAA$ of prompt $\Dsplus$ mesons was defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RAADs}
\RAA (\pt) = \frac{1}{\langle \TAA \rangle} \frac{{\rm d} N_{\rm AA}/{\rm d}\pt}{{\rm d} \sigma_{\rm pp}/{\rm d} \pt},
\end{equation}
where ${\rm d} N_{\rm AA}/{\rm d}\pt$ is the corrected $\pt$-spectrum of 
Eq.~\ref{eq:dNdpt}, $\langle \TAA \rangle$ is the 
average nuclear overlap function and ${\rm d} \sigma_{\rm pp}/{\rm d} \pt$ is 
proton-proton reference at $\s = 5.02$ TeV.
\section{Systematic uncertainty on the $\RAA$}
\label{sec:SystRAA}
The systematic uncertainties on the $\Raa$ measurement include those 
on the $\Ds$-meson corrected $\pt$-spectrum described above. The systematic 
uncertainty on the feed-down subtraction deriving from
the variation of the parameters of the FONLL calculation was considered to be
correlated in the $\PbPb$ and pp measurements. All the 
other sources of systematic uncertainties were treated as uncorrelated. 
Additional systematic uncertainties on the $\Raa$ are on 
the proton--proton reference cross section and on the $\RAA$ normalisation. 

\subsection{Proton-proton reference}
\label{sec:PPrefSyst}
The $\pt$-differential cross section of prompt $\Dsplus$ mesons with 
$|y|<0.5$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt s=5.02~\tev$, used as reference 
for the nuclear modification factor, was obtained by scaling the 
measurement at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ described in 
Chapter~\ref{chap:pp}~\cite{Acharya:2017jgo} to $\s = 5.02$ TeV 
with FONLL calculations~\cite{Cacciari:2012ny}. This measurement 
reaches up to $12~\Gevc$ for $\Ds$ mesons.
The uncertainty on the pp reference 
has two contributions. The first one is the global uncertainty on the measured 
$\pt$-differential $\Dsplus$-meson cross section at $\sqrt s=7$~TeV.
The second contribution is the $\pt$-dependent scaling factor 
from $\sqrts=7~\tev$ to $\sqrts=5.02~\tev$, determined by varying
the FONLL parameters (charm-quark mass, factorisation and renormalisation scales) 
as described in~\cite{Averbeck:2011ga}. 
In the interval $12<\pt<16~\Gevc$, the FONLL calculation at 
$\sqrt s=5.02~\tev$~\cite{Cacciari:2012ny} was used as a reference 
by scaling the values to match the central value of the data at lower $\pt$. 
This procedure is described in Ref.~\cite{Adam:2015sza}. The total 
systematic uncertainty on the $\pt$-extrapolated cross section is about 
$^{+29}_{-42}\%$ for $\Ds$ in the $\pt$ interval 12--16~$\Gevc$.


\subsection{Normalization}
\label{sec:NormalizSyst}
The uncertainties on the $\RAA$ normalisation are the quadratic sum of 
(i) the pp normalisation uncertainty (3.5\%), 
(ii) the uncertainty on $\langle T_{\rm AA} \rangle$, which ranges from 3.3\% to 6.2\% depending on the centrality, and
(iii) the uncertainty on the fraction of the hadronic cross section used in the 
Glauber fit to determine the centrality ($<0.1\%$, $2\%$ and $3\%$ for the 0--10\%, 30--50\% 
and 60--80\% centrality classes, respectively)~\cite{Adam:2015sza}, while the branching ratio uncertainty cancels out in the 
ratio.

\section{$\Ds$ elliptic flow}
In this section, the first measurement at LHC of the $v_2$ of 
$\Ds$ meson in Pb--Pb collisions at 
$\sqrtsNN = 5.02$~$\TeV$ is reported. The analysis was carried 
out for the 30-50\% centrality class, because it is the centrality
interval where the elliptic flow reaches its maximum value~\cite{Adam:2016izf}. 

\subsection{Event characterization: event plane}
\label{sec:EventPlane}
Let's briefly recall that the reaction plane ($\Psi_{\rm RP}$) is the 
plane formed by the impact parameter of the two colliding nuclei and the beam
direction. The orientation of the reaction plane or, in case of flow fluctuations, 
of the $n^{th}$-harmonic collision symmetry plane is estimated 
from the particle azimuthal distribution event-by-event
with the $n^{th}$-harmonic event-plane angle, $\psi_n^{\rm EP}$.
For a given harmonic $n$, one constructs the two-dimensional event-plane 
vector $\vec{Q}_n$ from the measured azimuthal distribution of 
particles produced in the event as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{f:qvector}
 \vec{Q}_n= {Q_{n,x} \choose Q_{n,y}} = {\sum_{i=0}^{N} w_i \cos (n\varphi_i) \choose \sum_{i=0}^{N} w_i \sin (n\varphi_i)}.
\end{equation}
The sums run over all reconstructed tracks in the case 
of the TPC, or segments of detectors with azimuthal 
segmentation like V0 or ZDC. The angle $\varphi_i$ is 
the azimuthal emission angle of the $i^{th}$ particle or the 
azimuthal coordinate of the $i^{th}$ detector element, respectively. 
For TPC tracks the weight $w_i$ can be unity or a specific 
function of $\pt$, useful to enhance the 
contribution of particle with large flow, improving 
the resolution on the event plane. For segmented detectors, $w_i$ is the 
signal observed in the $i^{th}$ detector element. The observed plane 
angle of the $n^{th}$ harmonic is given by the orientation of $\vec{Q}_n$:
\begin{equation}
\psi_n = \dfrac{1}{n} \tan^{-1} \left(\dfrac{Q_{n,y}}{Q_{n,x}}\right).
\end{equation}
Due to the finite number of detected particles, the
angular resolution on reaction plane $\Psi_{\rm RP}$ is limited and 
can be estimated for the $n^{th}$ harmonic as:
\begin{equation}
R_n = \langle {\rm cos}[n({\rm \psi}_n-{\rm \Psi}_{\rm RP})]) \rangle ,
\end{equation}
where the angle brackets denote an average over a large event sample.
The resolution term must be used to correct the flow coefficients as:
\begin{equation}
v_n = \frac{v_n^{obs}}{R_n}.
\end{equation}
It can be demonstrated that the the event plane resolution 
can be expressed as~\cite{Poskanzer:1998yz}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:epreso}
\left\langle \cos [km\left( \psi_m-\Psi_{\rm RP}\right)]\right\rangle = \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi }{8}} \chi_m \cdot {\rm e}^{-\chi_m^2/4} \cdot I_{(k-1)/2}(\chi_m^2/4)+I_{(k+1)/2}(\chi_m^2/4),
\end{equation}
where the equation has been written in terms of $km$ 
instead of $n$, $\chi_m= v_m/\sigma = v_m\sqrt{2N}$ ($N$ is the multiplicity) and 
$I_\nu$ is the Bessel function of order $\nu$.
$k$ is an integer number that accounts for the fact that the 
event plane of $m^{th}$ order can be used to compute all Fourier harmonics that are multiples
of $m$ (i.e. $km$). The expression for resolution in Eq.~\ref{eq:epreso} is
drawn in Fig.~\ref{fig:resoBessel} as a function of $\chi_m$, for 
different values of $k$. 
The mean cosine values are less than one, thus the 
correction always increases the Fourier coefficients.

 \label{fig:resoBessel}
\end{figure}
To measure the event plane resolution, one usually divide the
full sample of tracks into two independent sub-samples 
$a$ and $b$, with same multiplicity and rapidity coverage.
The two sub-events can for example be obtained by 
splitting the full event in two subsets of tracks using a random generator.
There is a simple relation for the correlations between 
two independent sub-sets and the true event plane:
\begin{equation}
\langle {\rm cos} [n({\rm \psi}^a_n-{\rm \psi}^b_n)) \rangle = 
\langle {\rm cos} [n({\rm \psi}^a_n-{\rm \Psi}_{\rm RP})] \rangle \langle {\rm cos} [n({\rm \psi}^b_n-{\rm \Psi}_{\rm RP})] \rangle .
\end{equation}
Since, given the conditions above, the resolution of each sub-sets is expected 
to be the same, their resolution can be obtained 
once the correlation between the two samples is known:
\begin{equation}
R_{n, sub} = \langle {\rm cos} [n({\rm \psi}^a_n-{\rm \Psi}_{\rm RP})] \rangle = \sqrt{\langle {\rm cos} [n({\rm \psi}^a_n-{\rm \psi}^b_n)] \rangle}.
\end{equation}
\iffalse
The full event resolution is obtained using 
Eq.?? from the resolution of sub-events {\bf trovare reference}:
\begin{equation}
R_{full} = R(\sqrt{2}\chi_{sub})
\end{equation}
because $\chi \propto \sqrt{N}$ and the full event has twice the multiplicity of the sub-events.\\
\fi
If the two sub-events are not equal or have different rapidity coverage,
at least three sub-samples are needed to determine the 
event-plane resolution in each of them. In this case, 
the resolution of the first sub-set $a$, for example, is determined as:
\begin{equation}
 \langle {\rm cos} [n({\rm \psi}^a_n-{\rm \Psi}_{\rm RP})] \rangle = 
\sqrt{\frac{\langle\cos [n(\psi_n^a-\psi_n^c)] \rangle \langle\cos [n(\psi_n^a-\psi_n^b)] \rangle}{\langle\cos [n(\psi_n^b-\psi_n^c)] \rangle}}\, .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Event plane measurement and corrections}

The determination of the event plane in ALICE can be performed using
either the tracks reconstructed in the TPC, which has an uniform
azimuthal coverage in the central rapidity region, or the V0
detectors, located at forward ($2.8<\eta<5.1$) and backward
($-3.7<\eta<-1.7$) pseudo-rapidity.
In this analysis the event plane was obtained from the 
signals produced by the charged particles in the eight 
azimuthal sectors of each V0 array. Since the V0s sub-detectors cover different rapidity 
regions and measure different multiplicities, at least 
three sub-events of charged particles are required to 
compute the event plane resolution.
They are the V0 detector itself and the 
positive and negative $\eta$ regions of the TPC.
The average resolution value in the 30-50\% centrality class is
$R_2 = 0.77045 \pm 0.00007$ (see left panel 
of Fig.~\ref{fig:resoVsDetConfig}) 
Other detector 
configurations have been tested in order to compare 
the resolution and check the consistency of the different 
results obtained:
\begin{enumerate}
\item event plane measured with $\eta > 0$ TPC region,  
resolution $R_2$ with two sub-samples: $\eta < 0$ TPC region, 
$\eta > 0$ TPC region;
\item event plane measured with $\eta > 0$ TPC region,  
resolution $R_2$ with three sub-samples: V0A, V0C, $\eta > 0$ TPC region; 
\item event plane measured with full TPC,  
resolution $R_2$ with three sub-samples: V0A, V0C, full TPC; 
\item event plane measured with V0C,  
resolution $R_2$ with three sub-samples:  $\eta < 0$ TPC region, $\eta > 0$ TPC region, V0C.
\end{enumerate}
The best resolution is obtained considering configuration 3, 
while the lowest resolution using configuration 4, due to
limited acceptance of the C-side of the V0 detector (see right panel 
of Fig.~\ref{fig:resoVsDetConfig}). 
The resolution obtained with three sub-events and full V0 for the event
plane measurement (default configuration) and the 
resolutions obtained with configurations 1 or 2 are very similar. 
The current uncertainties on the $v_2$ values do not allow to
appreciate different non-flow contributions (i.e.\,correlations not 
induced by the collective expansion but rather by decays and 
jet production) using different detectors
for the event plane measurement, thus, introducing different
rapidity gaps between the tracks used for the event plane measurement
and the D mesons (see left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:QoverMCalibration},
as an example for the $v_2$ of $\Ds$ meson with different detector configurations).
Nevertheless, the separation of at least 0.9 units of pseudo-rapidity 
($|\Delta\eta|>0.9$) between the D mesons (reconstructed in the TPC)
and the particles (detected with V0) used in the $\psi_2$ calculation
suppresses non-flow contributions in the $v_2$ measurement with respect
to the measurement of the event plane considering tracks in the same
pseudo-rapidity region of the D meson candidates (TPC event planes).
\\


\iffalse
multiplicity recorded in the two V0 detectors 
(V0A and V0C). A first equalization of the channels 
was performed online. Three different event planes 
(i.e. three different estimators of the participant symmetry plane) 
can be computed from the V0 detector information: 
the V0A and V0C event planes, coming from 
the two sub-detectors, and the event plane of the full V0. 
The resolution of the V0A (V0C) 
 event planes can be obtained using the V0A, 
 V0C and the TPC event planes, while for the full 
 V0 event plane we use as sub-events the TPC 
 event plane computed using only tracks with $\eta>0$, 
 only tracks with $\eta<0$ and the full V0 event plane. \\

   \label{fig:QoverMCalibration}
\end{figure}




Effects of non-uniformity of the detectors can generate 
non-flat distribution of the event planes.
For this purpose, a gain equalisation of individual 
V0 detector channels was applied, correcting the multiplicity $M_c$ 
as: $M_c' = M_c / \langle M_c \rangle$. 
A re-centering of the distributions of the components
of $\vec{Q}_n$ vector ($X_n$, $Y_n$) can also be applied, by subtracting
the ($\langle X_n\rangle$, $\langle Y_n \rangle$) values averaged over all events:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\emph{{X}}_n' =& \emph{X}_n - \langle \emph{X}_n \rangle,\\
\emph{{Y}}_n' = &\emph{Y}_n - \langle \emph{Y}_n \rangle.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Further corrections can be introduced but, as the right panel of 
Fig.~\ref{fig:QoverMCalibration} shows, already the re-centering
procedure leaves unaffected the event-plane distribution.
The $\vec{Q}_n$ vector was normalised for the
multiplicity M of the event to reduce the sensitivity to multiplicity
fluctuations. 


\subsection{Event-plane based methods for $v_2$ extraction} 
\label{sec:epMethodsDescript}
The basic principle in flow analysis is to quantify the azimuthal 
anisotropies via Fourier coefficients obtained through a 
decomposition of the measured azimuthal yields in a Fourier series:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dNdphi}
\frac{{\rm d} N}{{\rm d} \varphi} = k \cdot \big ( 1 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} v_n {\rm cos}[n (\varphi - \Psi_n)] ),
\end{equation}
where $k$ is a normalisation constant. 
The $v_2$ coefficient can be obtained by integrating Eq.~\ref{eq:dNdphi}
in two $\Delta \varphi$ intervals and including a correction for the
resolution. In the analysis presented here, the sample of candidates was 
divided in two $\Delta\phi$ regions: the \textit{in-plane} 
and the \textit{out-of-plane} regions. We define the in-plane 
region (centred on the event plane) as the region 
$\left(-\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{\pi}{4}\right]\cup\left(\frac{3\pi}{4},\frac{5\pi}{4}\right]$ and
 the out-of-plane as $\left(\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{3\pi}{4}\right]\cup\left(\frac{5\pi}{4},\frac{7\pi}{4}\right]$. 
 Reducing the splitting in $\Delta\phi$ to only two bins allows 
 to improve the statistics for each invariant mass fit. Resolving 
 Eq.~\ref{eq:dNdphi} for the number of signals measured 
 in the in-plane and out-of-plane regions separately we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ninout}
 \begin{split}
  & N_\text{in-plane} = k\int_\text{in-plane}1+2v_2\cos(2\varphi)d\varphi = k'\cdot(\pi+4v_2)\\
  & N_\text{out-plane} = k\int_\text{out-plane}1+2v_2\cos(2\varphi)d\varphi= k'\cdot(\pi-4v_2),
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
and therefore it is possible to compute $v_2$ from the relative 
difference between the number of signal observed in-plane and out-of-plane:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:anis}
 v_2 = \frac{1}{R_2} \frac{\pi}{4}\frac{N_\text{in-plane}-N_\text{out-plane}}{N_\text{in-plane}+N_\text{out-plane}}.
\end{equation}
The contribution of all odd harmonics, 
as well as $v_4$ and $v_8$, to the $v_2$ value induce the same average 
contribution to $N_\text{in-plane}$ and $N_\text{out-of-plane}$ 
due to symmetry, and therefore they do not affect $v_2$ calculated with 
Eq.~\ref{eq:anis}. The contribution of $v_6$, $v_{10}$ and higher 
harmonics is assumed to be negligible based on the 
values measured for light-flavour hadrons~\cite{Aamodt:2011by,ATLAS:2012at}.
The factor $\frac{1}{R_2}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:anis} is the correction for the finite resolution in the
estimate of the symmetry plane $\Psi_2$ via the event plane $\psi_2$.
 Simulations showed that the D-meson reconstruction 
 and selection efficiencies do not depend on $\Delta\varphi$~\cite{Abelev:2014ipa}, 
therefore Eq.~\ref{eq:anis} can be applied using the 
D-meson raw yields, without an efficiency correction.

 \subsection{In- and out-of-plane signal extraction}
 \label{sec:SigExtracV2}
 The topological selections used for the extraction of
 in-plane and out-of-plane $\Dspm$ yields in the 30-50\% centrality class
 are very similar to those reported in Table~\ref{tab:topologicalselections_ds_3050} for the
 $\varphi$-integrated yields in the same centrality class.
 Only the selections on NDL$_{\rm xy}$, $\sigma_{vertex}$, $\Delta M$ 
 and $|\cos^3 \theta^\prime({\rm K})|$ were slightly released in some $\pt$
 intervals. The $\Dspm$ in- and out-of-plane invariant-mass distributions, 
with the event plane determined by the V0 multiplicity 
in the 30-50\% centrality class, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:deltaphibinsds} 
as an example for the interval $6 < \pt < 8 \, \Gevc$.
The fit was performed using a double Gaussian function to model 
the $\Ds$ peak and the contribution of the $\DplustoKKpi$ and 
an exponential shape to model the background.
The mean and the width of the Gaussians were fixed to those obtained from a fit to
the invariant-mass distribution integrated over $\Delta \varphi$, 
where the signal has higher statistical significance. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:deltaphibinsds} shows the values of Gaussian means and 
widths for the in-/out-of-plane and the $\varphi$-integrated extracted yields.
The yields in the two $\varphi$ regions were extracted in five $\pt$ 
intervals between 2 and 16 $\Gevc$.
The values of the extracted raw yields and the signal-over-background 
ratios for the in-plane and out-of-plane invariant-mass fits 
are reported in Table~\ref{signalsDs}.

\subsection{B feed-down subtraction}
\label{sec:FDv2}
The measured $\Dspm$ meson raw yield includes a contribution (around 90\%)
from prompt D mesons and a contribution from beauty feed-down.
Considering that $v_2$ is an additive quantity, the measured $v_2$ is therefore given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bfeed}
v_2^{\rm obs}=f_{\rm prompt} v_2^{\rm promptD} + (1-f_{\rm prompt})v_2^{\rm feed-down}.
\end{equation}
The value of $f_{\rm prompt}$ is estimated using the FONLL prediction for B mesons, 
the B$\rightarrow$D decay kinematics from the EvtGen package and
the Monte Carlo efficiencies for feed-down D mesons, via Eq.~\ref{eq:fprAA},
with the same hypothesis for the $\RAA^{\rm feed-down}$ of 
Sec.~\ref{sec:CorrectionsAA}.
To calculate $v_{\rm 2}^{\rm prompt}$, a hypothesis on 
$v_{\rm 2}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}$ is used.
The measured $v_2$ of non-prompt J/$\psi$~\cite{Khachatryan:2016ypw} 
and the available model calculations~\cite{Aichelin:2012ww,Uphoff:2012gb,Greco:2007sz} 
suggest that $0<v_{\rm 2}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}<v_{\rm 2}^{\rm prompt}$.
The lower limit, $v_2^{\rm feed-down}=0$, corresponds to the assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{at low $\pt$, where $v_2$ is determined by collective motions, 
$b$ quarks do not flow and hence do not contribute to the anisotropy;}
\item{at high $\pt$, where $v_2$ is determined by azimuthal dependent 
energy loss, due to different in-plane and out-of-plane path lengths, 
$b$ quarks are not affected by the medium.}
\end{itemize}
The upper limit, $v_2^{\rm feed-down}=v_2^{\rm prompt}$, implies that:
\begin{itemize}
\item{at low $\pt$, $b$ quarks are as thermalised as $c$ quarks;}
\item{at high $\pt$, $b$ and $c$ quarks lose same amount of energy interacting with the medium.}
\end{itemize}
Assuming a uniform probability distribution of $v_{\rm 2}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}$ in this interval,
the central value for $v_{\rm 2}^{\rm prompt}$ is calculated 
considering:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hypoFD}
v_{\rm 2}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}=v_{\rm 2}^{\rm prompt}/2,
\end{equation}
thus:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:finalv2}
v_{\rm 2}^{\rm prompt}= 2\,v_{\rm 2}^{\rm obs}/(1+f_{\rm prompt}).
\end{equation}

\section{Systematic uncertainties on $v_2$}
\label{sec:systsectionV2}
The main sources of systematic uncertainty affecting the measurement of 
$v_2$ are related to: 
\begin{itemize}
\item signal extraction from the invariant-mass
distribution;
\item centrality dependence of the resolution term $R_2$;
\item B feed-down subtraction;
\item non-flow effects;
%\item residual non-flatness of the event plane.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Yield extraction systematics}
\label{sec:rawYv2}
The systematic uncertainty on the yield extraction was 
estimated by testing different fit configurations.
Fits were performed by varying: (i) background fit functions
(exponential, first and second order polynomial functions), (ii) invariant-mass bin
widths, (iii) lower and upper limits in the fit, (iv) Gaussian peak widths free or fixed to the value
extracted from the $\varphi$-integrated distribution. Furthermore, the yield was defined by
counting the histogram entries in the invariant-mass region of the signal, after subtracting the background
contribution estimated from a fit to the side bands. The distributions of
residuals between the $i^{th}$ trial and the reference $v_2$ value, 
$v_2^{trial}-v_2^{ref}$, were obtained in each $\pt$ interval. 
The systematic uncertainty was evaluated
considering both the shift with respect to zero and the RMS of the residual
distributions. The absolute values of this uncertainty range from 
0.015 to 0.070 for $\Ds$ mesons, depending on the $\pt$ interval.

\subsection{Event Plane resolution}
\label{sec:EPreso}
The event-plane resolution correction $R_2$ depends on the 
collision centrality~\cite{Abelev:2014ipa}. Left-hand panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:EtaGapSyst} shows
resolution $R_2$ as a function of the centrality in the interval
30-50\%, computed using V0 arrays, negative and positive TPC
regions, with and without the introduction of a 
pseudo-rapidity gap between the two considered TPC regions.
The value of resolution used in Eq.~\ref{eq:anis} was computed
 assuming a uniform distribution of the D-meson yield within 
 the centrality class, event though their production yield
scales approximately with the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions.
This value was hence compared with those obtained from two alternative approaches
based on weighted averages of the $R_2$ values in narrow centrality 
intervals, using as weights either the D-meson yields or the number of 
nucleon-nucleon collisions. 
A systematic uncertainty of 2\% on $R_2$ was estimated from 
this study.

\caption{Event plane resolution as a function of centrality estimated introducing an eta gap between the sub-events computed using the TPC tracks (left) and the corresponding relative variation with respect to the default configuration (right).}
\label{fig:EtaGapSyst}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Non-flow contributions}
\label{sec:NonFlow}
In order to estimate a possible bias 
in the event plane resolution due to non-flow contributions, 
the resolution was re-computed introducing 
a pseudo-rapidity gap between the sub-events. 
In particular it was considered an eta 
gap of 0.1 and 0.2 between the sub-events computed using
 the TPC tracks with positive/negative 
eta. The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:EtaGapSyst} shows
 the comparison of the event plane resolution
as a function of centrality computed without eta gap, 
with an eta gap of 0.1, with an eta gap 0.2. 
In the latter case the resolution was also computed 
applying the $\pt$ weights in the measurement of
the event plane of the two sub-events obtained from the tracks in the TPC.
In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:EtaGapSyst} the corresponding 
relative variation of the event plane average resolution in the
30-50\% class is shown. Considering this observation an additional 1\%
 systematic uncertainty on the determination of the
event plane resolution was assigned.
\iffalse
\subsection{EP flatness}
\label{sec:EPflat}
In order to check the flatness of the event plane 
distributions several checks have been performed 
for the main configuration used (main event plane 
measured with the multiplicity in the full V0 and
 resolution estimated with 3 sub-events). In particular, if we consider that
\begin{equation}
\cos(2\Delta\phi) = \cos(2\phi_D-2\psi_{EP}) = \cos(2\phi_D)\cos(2\psi_{EP})+\sin(2\phi_D)\sin(2\psi_{EP}),
\end{equation}
where $\phi_D$ is the azimuthal angle of the D meson 
and $\psi_{EP}$ the azimuthal angle of the event plane, 
a non-zero value of 
$< \cos(2\phi_D) >/R_2 \times < \cos(2\psi_{EP}) >/R_2$ 
(and the same for the sine) would lead to a bias in the 
measurement of the D-meson $\vtwo$. The  
$< \cos(2\psi_{EP}) >$ and $< \sin(2\psi_{EP}) >$ factors 
have been extracted from the fits to the event plane 
distributions shown in Fig.. The fitting functions used are respectively 
\begin{equation}
N(1+2b\cdot \cos(2\psi_{EP}))
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
N(1+2b'\cdot \sin(2\psi_{EP})),
\end{equation}
where $b = < \cos(2\psi_{EP}) >$ and $b' = < \sin(2\psi_{EP}) >$.
In particular for the full V0, we can observe how the parameters 
extracted with this method are smaller than 0.001.


To estimate $< \cos(2\phi_D) >$ and $< \sin(2\phi_D) >$ 
have been used two methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item The subtraction of the $\cos(2\phi_D)$ ($\sin(2\phi_D)$) 
distribution of the combinatorial background from the distributions of the side-bands.
\item The fit of the $\cos(2\phi_D)$ ($\sin(2\phi_D)$) vs. the invariant-mass.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:fPrompt}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feed down systematics}
\label{FDsystV2}
The systematic uncertainty from feed-down on $v_{2}^{\rm prompt}$ 
is estimated by varying the central value of 
$v_{2}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}=v_{2}^{\rm prompt}/2$ by $ \pm v_{2}^{\rm prompt}/\sqrt{12}$, corresponding to 
$\rm \pm 1\,RMS$ of a uniform distribution in $(0,\,v_{2}^{\rm prompt})$.
The value of $v_2^{\rm prompt}$ is computed from:
\begin{equation}
v_{2}^{\rm prompt}=v_{2}^{\rm obs}/f_{\rm prompt} - (1-f_{\rm prompt})/f_{\rm prompt}v_{2}^{\rm feed-down}.
\end{equation} 
The maximum and minimum values of $v_2^{\rm prompt}$ were
obtained using respectively the minimum and the maximum values 
of $v_{\rm 2}^{\rm feed-down}$ and $f_{\rm prompt}$. 
The uncertainty on $f_{\rm prompt}$ is obtained from the
variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales and of the charm
mass in the FONLL calculation, and from the variation of the 
$R_{\rm AA}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}$ hypothesis in  
$\frac{1}{3}< R_{\rm AA}^{\rm feed\textnormal{-}down}/R_{\rm AA}^{\rm prompt}<3$~\cite{Adam:2015jda}. 
The values of $f_{\rm prompt}$ of $\Ds$ mesons
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fPrompt} and the error bars include the
contributions of the FONLL scales variations and of the variation of
the $\RAA$ hypothesis. The value of the absolute systematic uncertainty from feed-down ranges from 0.001 to 0.030.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:PbPbResults}
The transverse-momentum distributions d$N$/d$\pt$ of prompt $\Dsplus$ mesons 
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DmesCorrYields010}
for the 0--10\%, 30--50\% and 60--80\% centrality classes. 
They are compared to the corresponding pp cross-section
reference multiplied by $\langle T_{\rm AA} \rangle$.
The vertical bars represent the statistical uncertainties, the empty boxes
the systematic uncertainties from the data analysis, and the shaded boxes
the systematic uncertainty due to the subtraction of the feed-down from 
B-hadron decays. The uncertainty on the branching ratios is quoted separately.\\
%Uncertainties on the pp cross section
%normalisation and on the branching ratios are quoted separately.





Figure~\ref{fig:DmesRatio} shows, in the top panels, the $\pt$-dependent ratios of
$\Ds/\Dzero$ and $\Ds/\Dplus$ meson yields in the three centrality classes and in pp 
collisions at $\s = 7$ TeV~\cite{Acharya:2017jgo}. For comparison, the ratios of 
non-strange $\Dplus$/$\Dzero$, $\Dstar$/$\Dzero$ meson yields
are also shown in the bottom panels.
The $\Dplus$/$\Dzero$ and $\Dstar$/$\Dzero$ ratios are compatible in Pb-Pb and pp collisions, 
indicating no significant modification of their relative abundances. 
The $\Ds/\Dzero$ and $\Ds/\Dplus$ ratios are measured with better 
precision at 5.02~TeV with respect to 2.76~TeV.
The central values of these ratios are larger in Pb-Pb than in pp collisions, 
in all three centrality classes, however the measurements in the two systems 
are compatible within about one standard deviation of the combined uncertainties.\\

The $\Raa$ of prompt $\Dsplus$ mesons is shown, for the three different centrality classes,
in the Fig.~\ref{fig:DmesRaa}, where it is compared to the average $\Raa$ of non-strange 
D mesons. The $\Dsplus$ nuclear modification factors in the 0--10\% 
and 30--50\% centrality classes show a suppression that is
maximal at $\pt=6$--$10~\gev/c$, where a reduction of the yields by
a factor of about 3 and 1.5 with respect to the binary-scaled
 pp reference is observed in the two centrality classes, respectively.
The average $\RAA$ in the 60--80\% centrality class is compatible 
with unity, without a pronounced dependence on $\pt$.
 The central values of the $\RAA$ are larger for $\Ds$ mesons, but the measurements 
 of strange and non-strange D-meson suppression are 
compatible within one standard deviation of the combined 
uncertainties, as in the case of the ratios shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DmesRatio}.\\




In Fig.~\ref{fig:DandDsRaaWithModels},  the non-strange and 
strange D-meson $\RAA$ are compared with  
the PHSD~\cite{Song:2015ykw} and 
 TAMU~\cite{He:2014cla} models that provide both observables. A large increase of
 the $\Ds$ $\RAA$ is expected in the two models, in particular for $\pt<5~\gev/c$, with respect to 
 non-strange D mesons. Both the calculations are heavy-flavour transport code
 based on a Langevin approach.
In TAMU the interactions are only described by collisional (i.e.\,elastic) processes, 
while in PHSD~\cite{Song:2015ykw} also energy loss from medium-induced gluon radiation
is considered, in addition to collisional process.
The increase of $\Ds$ $\RAA$ with respect to non-strange D mesons is induced by hadronisation 
 via quark recombination in a strangeness-rich QGP, as well as by different 
interaction cross sections for non-strange D and for $\Ds$ in 
the hadronic phase of the system evolution. It is interesting
 to note that the TAMU model gives a larger effect than the 
 PHSD model and that the central values of the two measured $\RAA$ differ also 
in the region around $\pt=10~\gev/c$, where the effect in the 
models becomes small, although the present experimental 
uncertainties prevent us from drawing a firm conclusion. \\

The $v_2$ of prompt $\Ds$ mesons in
the 30--50\% centrality class is shown as a function of $\pt$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:v2_Ds}.
The symbols are positioned at the average $\pt$ of the 
reconstructed mesons: this value was determined as the 
average of the $\pt$ distribution of candidates in the signal invariant-mass region, 
after subtracting the contribution of the background 
candidates estimated from the side bands.
The average $v_2$ of $\Ds$ meson in
 the intervals $2<\pt<8~\gev/c$ is 
 positive with a significance of 2.6\,$\sigma$,
where $\sigma$ is the uncertainty of the average $v_2$, 
calculated using quadratic error propagation for the
 statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties 
(signal extraction) and linear propagation for the correlated 
systematic uncertainties ($R_2$ and feed-down correction).
The $v_2$ of $\Ds$ is compared to the average $v_2$ of
$\Dzero$, $\Dplus$ and $\Dstar$ as a function of $\pt$ in the right
panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:v2_Ds}.\\


In Fig.~\ref{fig:v2_models}, a comparison of $v_2$ measurement
and theoretical calculations is presented.
Both TAMU and PHSD predict similar $v_2$ for strange and non-strange
D mesons. The TAMU model describes the magnitude of the elliptic flow, 
but fails in reproducing the shape, probably due to the missing radiative term for the energy loss. 
Larger statistical samples are essential to reduce the current
uncertainties and will allow firmer constraints on the models
via simultaneous comparison of $\RAA$ and elliptic flow $v_2$
measurements.
